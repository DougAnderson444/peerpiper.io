PeerPiper.io - Instantly update your connections using HyPNS.
</p>

A [Sapper](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper)-based, [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)-deployed project running [HyPNS](https://github.com/DougAnderson444/HyPNS) via [HyPNS-Svelte-Component](https://github.com/DougAnderson444/HyPNS-Svelte-Component) and [IPFS Core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ipfs-core).

## Dev Notes

This project uses Svelte as a front-end with Sapper  framework,  

This project uses vercel functions, for the vercel now functon to work, run
```bash
vercel:dev
```

For production, it's deployed to Vercel now.

```

### Package.json

Dependencies are located in devDepencies so when this project is pushed to Vercel the size is kept small as devDependencies aren't included in the limited bundle size of Now.
