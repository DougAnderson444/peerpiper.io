# PeerPiper.io

PeerPiper is mecentralizing the internet.

## How we do it

It all starts with a little self sovreign identity, sprinkle in a little peer-to-peer data sharing,
layer on some helpful apps, and voila! An internet centralized around YOU. 

## Deployed with Dat

Everyone is talking about IPFS, but I really like Dat. Because the Dat URL doesn't change when you update the content like IPFS.
